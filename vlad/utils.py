def RootSIFT(descs):
    """Convert usual SIFT-descriptors to RootSIFT as proposed in [1]

    Parameters
    ----------
    descs : array_like
        The SIFT-descriptors to adapt

    Returns
    -------
    descs : array_like
        Same type as input, output are the RootSIFT-converted descriptors

    Notes
    -----
    RootSIFT in relation to regular SIFT-descriptors consists in taking the square-root of
    the L1-normalized SIFT-descriptors [1]. It's very easy to implement and therefore
    demonstrated as a function in this repository.
